It is with pleasure that I congratulate you, Mr. President, and your friendly country on your election as the President of the General Assembly at its current session. I wish you success in managing the work of the Assembly. I would also like to express thanks and appreciation to the former President of the General Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his efforts in leading the previous session competently and professionally.
Let me also express the Kingdom of Bahrain’s appreciation and support for His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his outstanding efforts aimed at reinforcing the role of the international Organization, contributing to the maintenance of international peace and security, protecting human rights, coordinating humanitarian relief operations and supporting the Sustainable Development Goals, climate action and environmental protection.
The general debate of the current session is taking place amid armed conflicts in most parts of the world and shared economic challenges of extreme importance and danger, which, if left unresolved, together with the increased menace posed by terrorist organizations in various parts of the world — a challenge that has not been comprehensively addressed — would lead to wider conflict and greater destruction, killing, misery, human deprivation and displacement of innocents, thereby threatening the lives of those living in peace, especially women and children, and preventing individuals and societies from enjoying their most basic rights to a dignified and stable life. Those threats impose the necessity of international partnership and joint coordination at bilateral and multilateral levels to end wars and conflicts and resolve them through dialogue and peaceful means, encourage constructive cooperation among great Powers to achieve international peace and security, combat extremism and terrorism by eradicating their financial, organizational and ideological foundations, and addressing any political, economic or social problems that may fuel conflicts, disputes or hatred.
My country believes that the only way to resolve existing regional and international crises is through adherence to the principles of the United Nations, most important, respecting sovereignty and international law, not interfering in the internal affairs of countries, achieving consensus on more effective mechanisms to avoid future conflicts, resolving conflicts or disputes before they break out, ending the heavy loss of life and property and channelling financial resources to lift millions of people out of hunger, poverty and illness, instead of wasting wealth on igniting hostility and hatred.
In order to avoid or prevent future conflicts, we must do everything in our power to resolve conflicts or disputes before they turn violent. To do that, we must believe in the essential role of promoting the values of tolerance, coexistence, mutual respect and dialogue in trying to prevent the outbreak of conflicts and preserving security and building cooperation and confidence among countries.
The United Nations remains a crucial element in supporting dialogue and peaceful coexistence among cultures and civilizations, reinforcing human solidarity in addressing the problems of poverty and hunger, allocating greater resources to assist the least developed countries and the most disadvantaged groups and encouraging scientific research and exchanging experiences in preserving the environment and treating diseases and pandemics.
The security and stability of the Middle East region is a fundamental pillar of international peace and security, with this vital and strategic region facing wars and crises that have caused enormous human and economic losses, displaced millions, threatened navigation, trade, energy, water and food security and deprived millions of the young people of the region of hope and optimism for a better and more prosperous future.
Under the leadership of His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa A1 Khalifa, the Kingdom of Bahrain has always stressed, in all its diplomatic stances and effective international responses, the need for international cooperation and partnership on the basis of brotherly relations, understanding and the principles of good- neighbourliness and respect for the sovereignty of countries and non-interference in their internal affairs. We also have always stressed priority for dialogue and diplomatic solutions in settling regional and international conflicts and tensions, and consolidating peaceful coexistence among all religions, civilizations and cultures, based on the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law.
The Kingdom of Bahrain has prioritized strengthening integration and interdependence among the countries of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) and their sisterly peoples and building on the achievements made in following up on the outcomes of the A1 Ula summit of the GCC. We have been working to fulfil the requirements for achieving economic unity and establishing joint development programmes, as well as the defence and security systems, so as to enhance the security, stability and unity of the GCC countries and their effective role at the regional and international levels. The Kingdom of Bahrain is also eager to preserve the security, stability, unity and territorial integrity of Arab countries as integral to its national security. We have confidence in the ability of our sisterly countries to resolve their crises and overcome any differences through political dialogue.
The Kingdom of Bahrain believes that achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East region depends primarily on settling the Palestinian- Israeli conflict in accordance with the two-State solution, resolutions of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative. Based on those established principles and values, the Kingdom of Bahrain has undertaken important initiatives such as hosting the Peace to Prosperity workshop and signing the Abraham Accords: Declaration of Peace, Cooperation and Constructive Diplomatic and Friendly Relations, which has entered its third year, embodying the importance of cooperation instead of confrontation and conflict, and working to build trust and partnerships in order to meet the aspirations of peoples for security, peaceful coexistence, prosperity and sustainable development.
In that context, the Kingdom of Bahrain welcomes the existing truce in Yemen, with the support and sponsorship of the United Nations, in line with the initiative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its efforts to reach a comprehensive and sustainable political solution to the Yemeni crisis, in accordance with the GCC Initiative and its Implementation Mechanism, the outcomes of the Comprehensive National Dialogue Conference and resolution 2216	(2015),	which emphasize the importance of opening all humanitarian corridors and enhancing economic and development support for the Yemeni people.
We also stress our support for the legitimate historical rights of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Republic of the Sudan to the waters of the Nile River and for the protection of their water security. We support those countries’ efforts to reach a binding legal agreement on filling and operating the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam in a way that benefits all parties, in accordance with the rules of international law.
We reiterate our firm stance and solidarity with the sisterly Kingdom of Morocco in preserving its security and territorial integrity, and we value resolution 2602 (2021) on Moroccan Sahara.
The Kingdom of Bahrain affirms its interest in establishing friendly and balanced relations with all countries in the Middle East region, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, in compliance with the United Nations Charter, international law, the principles of good-neighbourliness and non-interference in the affairs of other countries, while respecting international law and the sovereignty of States and their religious and cultural values and refraining from the use or threat of use of force. We call upon Iran to fully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency and work to make the Middle East region, including the Arabian Gulf, a zone free of weapons of mass destruction.
Under the wise leadership of His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa A1 Khalifa and the direction of the Government led by His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Hamad A1 Khalifa, the Crown Prince and Prime Minister, the Kingdom of Bahrain has been able to turn challenges into opportunities and success stories, thanks to the team work characterized by responsibility and a united spirit, placing at the forefront of its priorities respect for human rights, human dignity, freedoms, welfare and security, as human beings are the real wealth of the country and the focus and purpose of the comprehensive development process.
Team Bahrain represents a pioneering and civilized model in overcoming the repercussions of the coronavirus disease pandemic, as the Kingdom provided free health services and examinations for all citizens and residents without discrimination. We administered nearly 3.5 million doses of vaccines, which is more than 230 per cent of the total population, 67 per cent of whom have also received a booster dose. That is in addition to launching, in March 2020, a financial and economic package worth $12 billion, equivalent to a third of gross domestic product, to support the most affected individuals and sectors and reduce the economic and social repercussions, leading to the Kingdom of Bahrain deservedly being placed first in the world, according to international indicators, in recovery rate, with Manama becoming the first
Healthy City in the Middle East region, pursuant to the World Health Organization.
In order to further enhance its development process, the Kingdom of Bahrain has continued to implement an integrated plan for economic recovery that includes the completion of an advanced national programme for employment and training of citizens, updating legislation and commercial procedures to attract foreign direct investment, launching major strategic development projects, modernizing infrastructure, establishing new investment and industrial zones and developing the oil and non-oil economic sectors, along with the shift to the fourth industrial revolution, with support for the digital economy and artificial-intelligence technologies, tourism, logistics and financial sectors, and promoting programmes for financial sustainability, economic stability and fiscal balance.
The Kingdom of Bahrain is also eager to follow up on its commitments to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and looks forward to presenting its second voluntary report on the implementation of the SDGs next year.
Out of its awareness of the interdependence among the environment, natural resources and human, food and water security, the Kingdom of Bahrain has stressed its support for the four major international initiatives in the field of climate change and its commitment to achieving net-zero by 2060, reducing emissions by 30 per cent by 2035, doubling green spaces and enhancing the effective use of energy and renewable energy sources. My country stresses the importance of strengthening international cooperation in protecting the environment and addressing climate change in a sustainable and equitable manner, while ensuring energy security. We express our support for the Saudi Green and Middle East Green initiatives and wish the sisterly Arab Republic of Egypt success in hosting and presiding over the twenty-seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in November in Sharm El-Sheikh.
My country will soon witness a new blossoming chapter on its democratic path, with the holding of its sixth round of parliamentary and municipal elections in November, so that the Parliament continues to exercise its legislative and oversight powers as an expression of the true will of the electorate within the framework of the coordination between the Shura Council and the Council of Representatives, where the fully elected Council of Representatives provides all Bahrainis with the opportunity to participate and the Shura Council ensures the inclusion of different groups, including minorities, from all walks of life.
The Kingdom of Bahrain is proud to have in place modern legislation compatible with its accession to seven of the nine major human rights instruments, thereby attaining the highest international human rights standards. The most prominent of our laws recently is the Alternative Sanctions and Measures Law, which has benefited more than 4,200 convicts since its implementation in May 2018, whose approach towards creating open prisons is in line with modern criminal justice systems; the law on restorative justice for children and the protection of children from ill treatment; and other legislation that supports human rights in a society based on freedom, equality, justice, security, tranquillity and social solidarity.
In order to enhance its human rights and development gains, my country’s Government has this year approved the national human rights plan for the period 2022 to 2026, which includes 102 projects prepared in cooperation with the Office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator and in consultation with representatives of the legislative, executive and judicial authorities, national human rights institutions and United Nations entities. The plan is currently being implemented through dialogue, interaction, transparency and community partnership as firm principles, in line with His Majesty the King’s reform approach and the Economic Vision 2030 and its principles based on sustainability, fairness and competitiveness.
Under the leadership of His Majesty the King, and with the support of His Royal Highness the Crown Prince and Prime Minister, the Kingdom of Bahrain is continuing its reform and diplomatic approach that supports international partnership to consolidate the values of peace, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, while rejecting extremism, hatred and terrorism, promoting and protecting human rights and supporting sustainable development and service to humankind. We call on the permanent members of the Security Council to de-escalate tensions and work on resolving disputes through dialogue and diplomatic means. We also call on all countries to reaffirm their commitment to the values of tolerance, coexistence, mutual respect and dialogue and to intensify their work together to confront and overcome all challenges for the good and happiness of all humankind and for peoples’ right to build a better future in which safety, peace and tranquillity prevail.
I wish you, Mr. President, success in your presidency of the General Assembly at its current session and in strengthening constructive cooperation among Member States in partnership with the United Nations and its main organs and agencies, in order to confront the ongoing challenges and take joint action for the sake of a world that enjoys security and peace and embodies growth and prosperity.
